# Ford Go-Bike Shares Exploration
## by Joshua Oshla Olaku


## Dataset

> The dataset consists of 183,412 rows and 16 columns. The data in this dataset is on users of Ford Go-Bike, with information of their ride duration in seconds, birth year, gender, user type, start station and end station information and start and end time for rides taken.


## Summary of Findings

> During the exploration, I found out after creating a variable called age from the birth years of the bike users that, the age of the riders does not have any correlation with the duration they ride bikes as expected even after doing a logarithmic transformation on the duration. I expected that the older people grow the less energy they have to ride bikes. I also saw that from the dataset, there are far more male riders than there are females. It was interesting to discover that even though there are more male riders than female riders, the female riders take more longer rides. This could be as a result of the fact that females may be slow riders who are mostly careful unlike the male riders. Interestingly also, The days that had the least number of rides seemed to be the days with the longest ride durations.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I am focusing on the gender that has the longest ride durations and the time of day and day of week in which they take these rides. To start, I show the distribution of ride duration which has a bell shape or somewhat a normal distribution. I then also show the distribution of age and then further show the realtionship between day and duration of rides and also that of time of day and duration of rides. afterwards I show ride duration by gender and user type and also ride duration against time of the day and gender.I've made
sure to use different color palettes for each quality variable to make sure it is clear that they're different between plots.
